Hello! I am Abhiram Kaushik (Abhiram Viswamitra on the web). I am a developer who likes to design and develop scalable distributed systems. I work as a Senior Software Developer at Flipkart, India's biggest online retail store, where I have the opportunity to work on the same. I usually dabble with java, queueing systems, ruby, rails, android amongst other things. I am passionate about data, dynamic languages and I had a stint with creative coding. Currently fiddling with R and data science.

When I'm not coding or thinking about code, you can find me usually trekking, or taking wedding photos. I'm passionate about both! You can find me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abhiram.viswamitra/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/abhiram-kaushik/23/6b4/77a/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/g33kb0ne/), [500px](https://500px.com/AbhiramViswamitra/), [github](http://github.com/viswamitra/).
